# DiceRoller
This library consists of a .NET dice roller written in C#.
A roller written in C is also available, however work on that roller is
stopped and it does not support the full feature-set of the C# roller.

To download DiceRoller, it is recommended that you install it via NuGet
(link coming soon).

To view the documentation on DiceRoller, including how to format dice
expressions and the API documentation, see [here](https://skizzerz.net/DiceRoller).
